Real Estate Marketplace SPA Documentation

Overview

This is a React Single Page Application that serves as a real estate marketplace. The application allows users to browse listed properties and read comments from other users. Users can also register and login to the application to gain access to additional features. Registered users have their own personal area from where they can add new properties, manage their properties, and view their personal information.
Features

- Homepage: The homepage displays a list of properties that guests can browse. Guests can also access a detailed page for each property where they can read more information about the property and leave comments.

- Authentication: The application uses Firebase Authentication to handle user registration and login. Guests can access a Login and Register component to create an account or login to their existing account.

- User Area: Once logged in, users have access to their own personal area where they can view their personal information, add new properties, and manage their existing properties.

- Property Management: Logged in users can add new properties and manage their existing properties from their personal area. Users can edit, preview, or delete their properties from this section.

- Comments: Logged in users can leave comments about properties from the detailed property page.

- Image Upload: When adding a new property, users can upload images of the property.

- Context: The application uses Context to get the logged in user across the app.

- Controlled Forms: All forms in the application are controlled.
  Router: The application uses React Router to handle navigation between pages and dynamically load components based on the URL path.

- Router Guards: Router guards have been implemented to limit access to pages that require authentication.
